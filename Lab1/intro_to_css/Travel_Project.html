<p><em><strong>There are many cities in Russia that you can visit:</strong></em></p>

<ol>
    <li>Moscow</li>
    <li>Saint Petersburg</li>
    <li>Novosibirsk</li>
</ol>

<p>
    <strong>Mocsow, saint Petersburg and Novosibirsk</strong> are three of the most famous russian cities for <em>travelers</em>.
    Each city had a lot of beautiful places and architecture.You can choose every of them to get a good trip, but <em>I</em> will recommend you to visit one of the most gorgeous cities - <em>Saint Petersburg!</em>.
</p>

<h2 id="SaintPetersburg"><em>Saint Petersburg</em></h2>

<p><strong>Bridges</strong>. <em>The Neva River</em> connects Lake Ladoga to the Baltic Sea, and during the summer navigation season tens of cargo ships per day follow this important route,
    making it necessary to <em>open the bascule bridges across the Neva</em> in central <strong>St. Petersburg</strong>.
    This is done after <em>midnight</em>, and during the <strong>White Nights</strong> especially it has long been a tradition for crowds to gather along the embankments to watch the raising of the bridges.
    The raised arches of <strong>Palace Bridge</strong> make for one of St. Petersburg's <em>most famous views</em>, but its as much the atmosphere of lazy revelry and contentment inspired by the eternal twilight
    that makes this such an <em>unmissable</em> St. Petersburg experience.

<h3>The Hermitage</h3>

<p>
    <strong>The Hermitage Museum</strong> now spans several sites, but for most visitors it is the main collection in the <em>Winter Palace</em> that is an
    essential component of any St. Petersburg <em>itinerary</em>. Here you'll find not only centuries of <em>European fine art and a rich collection
    of Greek and Roman antiquities</em>, but also the astonishingly opulent 18th and 19th century state rooms of <em>Russia's imperial family</em>.
    Since the summer of 2014, much of the Hermitage's renowned <em>collection of impressionist and post-impressionist art</em> (in terms of artistic
    quality, undoubtedly the highpoint of the collection) has been transferred across Palace Square to the <em>General Staff Building</em>, so if
    your main reason for visiting the Hermitage is to see the art, <em>then you have to consider making time</em> for the second location, possibly
    with a break for refreshments between the two.
</p>

<h2 id = "conclusion"><em>Conclusion</em></h2>

<p>
    <em>Saint Petersburg</em> is one of the most interesting and enchanting places to visit.
    Here you can meet everything that you need to upgrade your <em>vision of art</em> and take
    an <em>aesthetic performance</em> that you will not meet in the other russian countries.
    You <strong>should see</strong> this beauty!
