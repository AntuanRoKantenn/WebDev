    <h1>"The Vampire"</h1>
    <p>
        You who, like the stab of a knife,<br>
        Entered my plaintive heart;<br>
        You who, strong as a herd<br>
        Of demons, came, ardent and adorned,<br><br>

        To make your bed and your domain<br>
        Of my humiliated mind<br>
        — Infamous bitch to whom I'm bound<br>
        Like the convict to his chain,<br><br>

        Like the stubborn gambler to the game,<br>
        Like the drunkard to his wine,<br>
        Like the maggots to the corpse,<br>
        — Accurst, accurst be you!<br><br>

        I begged the swift poniard<br>
        To gain for me my liberty,<br>
        I asked perfidious poison<br>
        To give aid to my cowardice.<br><br>

        Alas! both poison and the knife<br>
        Contemptuously said to me:<br>
        "You do not deserve to be freed<br>
        From your accursed slavery,<br><br>

        Fool! — if from her domination<br>
        Our efforts could deliver you,<br>
        Your kisses would resuscitate<br>
        The cadaver of your vampire!"
