<h3 class="postname">"Many works, including Siddhartha (1922) and Steppenwolf (1927), of German-born Swiss writer
    Hermann Hesse concern the struggle of the individual to find wholeness and meaning in life; he won the Nobel Prize
    for literature in 1946."</h3>

<p>The combination of traumas of 1916-18 caused Hesse great mental anguish. His rejection by Germany, his father's death,
    and the illnesses of his wife and his son Martin caused Hesse to seek the aid of J. B. Lang, an associate of the
    famous psychologist Carl Gustav Jung. More than seventy sessions took place between Lang and Hesse from 1916 to 1917 .
    One result was that Hesse began to reexamine his whole system of values and to formulate a new one. All of his novels
    subsequent to <em>Demian</em> reflect his new thinking and his increased awareness of the workings of the human mind. The latter
    aspect becomes more obvious after 1919, although it seems that even in his earlier works Hesse was intuitively aware,
    though not formally schooled, in such matters. After 1919, one cannot fully understand or appreciate Hesse without a
    knowledge of such terms as <em>"unconscious", anima</em>, and "archetype."</p>

<p><strong>Demian</strong> was produced within two months' time in what one biographer and personal acquaintance of Hesse refers to as a "white heat."
    It was published under the pseudonym Emil Sinclair. One reason for the use of the pen name was the disfavor toward Hesse in Germany
    at the time. Had the novel been published under his real name, it would have been ignored. Under this guise, however, it was not only
    a success, but Sinclair was also awarded the Fontane Prize for new authors. Soon the truth became known through a careful style analysis.
    Hesse could not accept the prize, the monetary value of which he could have used, because he was already an established author.
    Even his friend, the renowned <em>Thomas Mann</em>, could not believe that this was the work of Hermann Hesse, so radical was his departure from
    his earlier work.</p>

<p>Structurally, <strong>Demian</strong> is the beginning of a pattern followed in all of Hesse's novels after 1919. The book falls loosely into three sections.
    The first of these deals with the protagonist's awareness of an inharmonious world and some action which causes the loss of his innocence and
    can be paralleled with the biblical fall from grace. The second section, which is the longest, concerns itself with the period of anguish and
    despair which follows the fall. The third portion contains some degree of enlightenment for the protagonist. In one manner or other, he learns
    to come to terms with his life and with himself. However, this is not a permanent state, and it can be assumed that the protagonist is able to
    achieve the heights of intense awareness and harmony only periodically, but, nevertheless, he is able to continue his existence in an easier
    manner than most people because he has occasionally tasted complete harmony. The only novel of Hesse's in which the protagonist both attains
    and maintains this concept of Nirvana is, appropriately enough, <em>Siddhartha</em>.</p>

<p>Through <em>Nausea’s narrative</em>, written as Roquentin’s diary, it becomes clear that Roquentin leads an empty existence, spending his days working through papers in

    and, as he goes about his research, shares small pleasantries with a fellow library user who he has named ‘the Autodidact’ and who is reading his way through Bouville’s

    a sense of overwhelming sickness at the knowledge that he exists in a world rife with other things and people existing. Little can stave off this nausea or the sense of
    meaninglessness in existence, except perhaps the creation of some form of art that will endure and transcend Roquentin’s life. A meditation on art and existence, politics
    and society, <strong>Nausea</strong>, which Iris Murdoch called the ‘Tour de Force of a young man,’ has become a staple novel in the existentialist reading list.</p>

    <strong>Nausea (1938), La Nausée</strong> in the original French, is Jean-Paul Sartre’s first novel and an exploration of his early thoughts on existentialism through the meandering existence
    of one man. Roquentin, a man on the brink of his thirtieth birthday, is undertaking a scholarly project in the small town of Bouville (modelled on Le Havre). Having travelled the world,
    he has settled on writing a biography of the Marquis de Rollebon, a minor figure in the French Revolution, in the hope that the book, once finished, will afford him some form of legacy
    that will transcend his mortal existence. Through Nausea’s narrative, written as Roquentin’s diary, it becomes clear that Roquentin leads an empty existence, spending his days working
    through papers in the local library, and his evenings in cafes and restaurants – all of this in suffocating isolation. He makes love without emotion to a local café owner occasionally,
    and, as he goes about his research, shares small pleasantries with a fellow library user who he has named ‘the Autodidact’ and who is reading his way through Bouville’s complete library
    alphabetically. This is the extent of Roquentin’s contact with other human life. In his isolation, Roquentin suffers from the nausea, as he calls it – a sense of overwhelming sickness
    at the knowledge that he exists in a world rife with other things and people existing. Little can stave off this nausea or the sense of meaninglessness in existence, except perhaps
    the creation of some form of art that will endure and transcend Roquentin’s life. A meditation on art and existence, politics and society, Nausea, which Iris Murdoch called the ‘Tour de Force of a young man,’
    has become a staple novel in the existentialist reading list.<br>
    Roquentin’s purpose in starting the diary which presents the narrative is to understand and document the nausea that he suffers, detailing his small perceptions so as to ruminate
    on their deeper meanings, and how he exists in relation to the world. This process of self-reflection is important to the novel, and, while overwhelming at first, will eventually provide
    Roquentin with the knowledge he seeks, namely that the consciousness of his own being is what defines his existence, and that his personal reality is all that exists. Ultimately,
    the diary proves a record of his rebirth, or perhaps one might say metamorphosis, from hopelessness to a sense of purpose as Roquentin, inspired by Some of these Days (a ragtime tune),
    determines, at the novel’s close, on writing a novel himself. Whether this epiphany of salvation through creation is ironic or not, here the creation of art, follwing the consumption of art,
    is used to provide meaning to an otherwise meaningless existence completing Roquentin’s transformation, which has been hinted at by images of metamorphosis throughout the novel.
    In finding aesthetic solutions to the fundamental problems of its main character, Nausea has echoes of Rilke’s The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge. Indeed, the two books are strongly linked
    thematically, both featuring a male narrator on the cusp of his thirtieth birthday who struggles with an intensified perception of the world around him. This manifests itself in a fear that must
    be worked out through self-reflection in diary form.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, Sartre’s later work, Being and Nothingness, sets out his form of existentialism in far clearer detail and provides an excellent companion piece to Nausea. For Sartre, every
    individual has total freedom over life, the ability to choose different paths at different moments. The ultimate choice is to choose being – that is, existence – over nothingness. It is a choice
    that is common to all, and by determining on creating a redemptive piece of art at the close of <em>Nausea</em>, Roquentin asserts his choice for existence over nothingness. It appears almost a non-choice
    on first examination, but it is in fact the largest of choices and the one that binds all humans together in a shared complicity to exist, to repress the nausea.</p>
